    "\"\"\"Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the \n",
    "ability to scale up to complex applications. Flask provides tools, libraries, and technologies that allow developers to\n",
    "build a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy to get started: Flask is easy to set up and get started with. It has a simple and minimalistic design, which \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Flexible: Flask is highly flexible and allows developers to customize the framework according to their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework, which makes it ideal for developing small applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalable: Flask is highly scalable and can be used to develop large applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open source: Flask is an open source framework, which means that developers can access the source code and modify it\n",
    "according to their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Extensible: Flask is highly extensible and allows developers to add additional features and functionality to the \n",
    "framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",

    "Ans: App routing in Flask is the process of mapping URLs to functions that are defined in the application. It is used to\n",
    "create a web application by defining the URLs that should be associated with each function. App routing allows us to \n",
    "create different pages for our web application, and it also allows us to create dynamic URLs that can be used to access \n",
    "specific resources. App routing is also used to create custom error pages, which can be used to display helpful messages\n",
    "when an error occurs. App routing is essential for creating a web application as it allows us to control how users \n",
